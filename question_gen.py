# The following script takes the shot metadata JSON files generated from the simulations
# and produces a dataset of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) suitable for training/evaluating
#
# Usage example:
#   python question_gen.py --dataset ds1 --num-options 6 --num-correct 2
# This will generate MCQs with 6 options per question, 2 of which are correct.
# The output will be written to outputs/ds1/raw_qa.jsonl
#
# To override the output path:
#   python question_gen.py --dataset ds1 --output raw_qa.jsonl
# This will write to raw_qa.jsonl in the current working directory.
